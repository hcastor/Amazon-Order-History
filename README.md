# Amazon-Order-History
This script is used to pull amazon order history from multiple accounts, and stores them locally. I created this since I have lots of amazon prime accounts, and I was always having to remember which account I used to order a specefic item if I needed to go back and get some information about the item.

#Usage
On the first run of getOrderHistory.py an accounts.csv file will be created. Fill this out with all your amazon accounts. Run the script again and the created history.html will contain all of your orders. Open it up in a browser and it should like a lot like amazon.com order history page.

#Disclaimer
amazonUI.css, and orderHistory.css are pulled from amazon.com, and are not my code. They are used by history.html to make the page look excatly like it does on amazon.com
